<p>Across all types of head-to-head competitions, winners are determined through “Best of” series, where competitors must win the majority of the games in the series. For example, e-sports competitions (e.g., League of Legends, Valorant) commonly use Best of 5 series, where the team that first reaches 3 wins is considered the winner.</p>
<p>Before the start of a series, it is typical for analysts to be asked for their predictions. In the case of a Best of 5 series, analysts can predict three possible series scores: 3-0, 3-1, or 3-2 (assuming they know the stronger team/player). These predictions often strike me as being based on some form of intuition; for example, analysts frequently predict a 3-2 score because two teams seem relatively evenly matched.</p>
<p>This got me thinking - when should you expect a series to go 3-0, 3-1, or 3-2? If you expect a team to have an X% chance of winning each game (or on average, they will win Y out of 10 games), what series score should you predict?</p>

<h3>Calculating the probability of each series outcomes</h3>
<p>Let’s start by making three assumptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, of the two players/teams, you know which team is better.</li>
<li>Second, you know (or can estimate) the percentage of games they should win against the other team. For example, Team A should beat Team B 70% of the time.</li>
<li>Third (and most critically for these calculations), the likelihood of the team winning each game is independent<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these assumptions, we can calculate the probability of each series outcome!</p>
<p>Suppose that you have two teams competing in a Best of 5 series: Team A and Team B. You believe that Team A is the better team, and that their (independent) probability of winning each game is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<div id="outcome-1-3-0" class="section level4">
<h4>Outcome 1: 3-0</h4>
<p>The first possible series outcome is a 3-0. Expressed in wins (W) and losses (L), this would be a <em>WWW</em> series. The probability of Team A winning all 3 games would be <span class="math inline">\(p \times p \times p = p^3\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="outcome-2-3-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Outcome 2: 3-1</h4>
<p>What about a 3-1 series? Those familiar with binomial theory will recall that the probability of 3 wins and 1 loss would be <span class="math inline">\(p^3 \times (1-p)\)</span>. However, we also need to multiply this by the number of ways in which a series could go 3-1.</p>
<p>There happen to be 3 ways that this can happen: <em>LWWW</em>, <em>WLWW</em>, or <em>WWLW</em>. Keep in mind that the series <em>WWWL</em> is not possible, as the series would have ended 3-0.</p>
<p>So then, the probability of a 3-1 series is <span class="math inline">\(3p^3(1-p)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="outcome-3-3-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Outcome 3: 3-2</h4>
<p>Finally, the series could go 3-2. The probably of 3 wins and 2 losses would be <span class="math inline">\(p^3 \times (1-p)^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are 6 ways a series could go 3-2: <em>LLWWW</em>, <em>LWLWW</em>, <em>LWWLW</em>, <em>WLLWW</em>, <em>WLWLW</em>, <em>WWLLW</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the probability of a 3-2 series is <span class="math inline">\(6p^3(1-p)^2\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="example" class="section level4">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>To make these probabilities tangible, let’s input in a value for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Let’s say that you think Team A has a 75% chance of winning each game. The respective probabilities of the three series outcomes would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>3-0: <span class="math inline">\(0.75^3 = 0.422\)</span>, or a 42.2% chance</li>
<li>3-1: <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 0.75^3 \times 0.25 = 0.316\)</span>, or a 31.6% chance</li>
<li>3-2: <span class="math inline">\(6 \times 0.75^3 \times 0.25^2 = 0.158\)</span> or a 15.8% chance</li>
</ul>
<p>This would mean the most likely series outcome is a 3-0 for Team A! Note that the probabilities here do not sum to 1 (they sum to 0.896) because there is an 11.4% chance that Team A would lose the series, either 0-3, 1-3, or 2-3.</p>

<h3>Comparing the probabilities of each series outcomes</h3>
<p>Now that we know the probability of each outcome as a function of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, we can calculate it for all values between 0.5 and 1 (since we assume that the team we have chosen is more likely to win).</p>
<p>This can easily be done in R.</p>
<p>First, create a dataframe with the series scores and probabilities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- data.frame(
  # repeat each outcome 51 times
  score = rep(c(&#39;3-0&#39;, &#39;3-1&#39;, &#39;3-2&#39;), each = 51),
  # repeat the sequence of probabilities from 0.5-1 (in 0.01 increments) once for each outcome
  p_win = rep(seq(0.5, 1, 0.01), times = 3)
)

# Preview of first few rows
data %&gt;% 
  head(5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   score p_win
## 1   3-0  0.50
## 2   3-0  0.51
## 3   3-0  0.52
## 4   3-0  0.53
## 5   3-0  0.54</code></pre>
<p>Next, we can apply the probabilities from the earlier section.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- data %&gt;% 
  mutate(p_outcome = case_when(
    # If 3-0
    score == &#39;3-0&#39; ~ (p_win**3),
    # If 3-1
    score == &#39;3-1&#39; ~ 3*(p_win**3)*(1-p_win),
    # If 3-2
    score == &#39;3-2&#39; ~ 6*(p_win**3)*((1-p_win)**2)
  ))

# Probabilities when p = 0.75
data %&gt;% 
  filter(p_win == 0.75)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   score p_win p_outcome
## 1   3-0  0.75 0.4218750
## 2   3-1  0.75 0.3164062
## 3   3-2  0.75 0.1582031</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the probabilities match what we calculated earlier!</p>
<p>Finally, we can create a plot to help us visualise how these probabilities change.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = p_win, y = p_outcome, colour = score)) + 
  geom_path() + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) + 
  labs(x = &#39;Probability of Team A winning each game&#39;,
       y = &#39;Probability of series outcome&#39;,
       colour = &#39;Series outcome&#39;) + 
  theme_bw()</code></pre>

<div id="takeaways" class="section level3">
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>What can we take away from this plot?</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is 0.50 (you think both teams are exactly evenly matched), it is equally likely that the series will go 3-1 or 3-2. There’s an 18.8% chance of each, which beats the 12.5% chance of a 3-0.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;% 
  filter(p_win == 0.5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   score p_win p_outcome
## 1   3-0   0.5    0.1250
## 2   3-1   0.5    0.1875
## 3   3-2   0.5    0.1875</code></pre>
<p>If you think the chances of Team A winning each game are between 50% and 66%, the most likely outcome is a 3-1.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Team A has a 66% chance of winning, the probability of a 3-1 series (29.3%) is slightly higher than a 3-0 series (28.7%).</li>
<li>If this increases to 67%, the probability of a 3-0 series (30.1%) overtakes the probability of a 3-1 series (29.8%).</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;% 
  filter(p_win %in% c(0.66, 0.67))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   score p_win p_outcome
## 1   3-0  0.66 0.2874960
## 2   3-0  0.67 0.3007630
## 3   3-1  0.66 0.2932459
## 4   3-1  0.67 0.2977554
## 5   3-2  0.66 0.1994072
## 6   3-2  0.67 0.1965185</code></pre>
<p>If you think Team A has anything higher than a 67% chance of winning, the most likely outcome is a 3-0 series.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this means, that a 3-2 series is never the single-most likely outcome. Even if you believe that two teams are perfectly matched, it only becomes equally likely as a 3-1 series. (Perhaps this may have been intuitive to others, but it came as a surprise to me!)</p>

<div id="concluding-thoughts" class="section level3">
<h3>Concluding thoughts</h3>
<p>This was an interesting exercise for myself to understand how I should expect a Best of series to go based on my estimates of team/player strengths. It definitely came as a surprise to learn how unlikely 3-2 series are (though this may have been intuitive to others)!</p>
<p>Naturally, the calculations are only specific to a Best of 5 series, and they also assume that your goal is to predict the most likely outcome (which it would be, if you were an analyst).</p>
<p>In the next two parts, we’ll expand in two directions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How would we generalise these probability calculations to other (odd) Best of series? E.g., a Best of 3, Best of 7, etc.</li>
<li>Would we choose differently if our goal was not to predict the outcome, but maximise our expected value in betting on the right outcome?</li>
</ol>
<p><b id="f1">1</b> In reality, this is unlikely to be the case. Momentum often seems to play a pivotal role in the outcome of a series. For example, if a team loses a long, drawn out game, this may affect their mentality and performance in the subsequent games. <a href="#a1">↩︎</a></p>
