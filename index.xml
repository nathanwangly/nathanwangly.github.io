      <description>Hello! This is a personal website I created to share a bit about myself, what I’ve been reading, and (very occasionally) thoughts others might be interested in.
I currently work as a Senior Behavioural Scientist at ANZ (previously CommBank), where my aim is to take an evidence-based approach to improving the financial outcomes of our customers.
I’m also in my final year of my PhD at UNSW Sydney, with my research centred around how uncertainty influences the way we make financial decisions.</description>

★★★☆☆ 3 stars
★★☆☆☆ 2 stars

      <description>Page under development :)
I enjoy reading books that are directly related to behavioural science, related to an adjacent field (e.g., design thinking, data science), or that share interesting ideas and perspectives.
My goal in maintaining this list is to motivate myself to note my thoughts after each book, which I can always come back to reference in the future.
2023 Books Below, you’ll find the books I’m currently reading or have read this year.</description>
