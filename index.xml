      <description>Hello! This is a personal website I created to share a bit about myself and my work.
I currently work as a Senior Behavioural Scientist at ANZ (previously CommBank), where my aim is to take an evidence-based approach to improving the financial outcomes of our customers.
I also recently completed my PhD in Psychology at UNSW Sydney, with my research centred around how uncertainty influences the way we make saving decisions.</description>
