About a year ago, I began working on a research project with Yiwei Zhang (Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison), Abigail Sussman (Associate Professor, University of Chicago), and Jennifer Lyu (PhD student, University of Colorado Boulder). Yiwei, Abby, and Jen had recently surveyed U.S. respondents on their budgeting beliefs and behaviours, and were interested in knowing whether we could use objective bank data to support (or contradict) their findings. This kicked off a large data exploration exercise as we used data from CBA to search for real-world analogues to the questions that had been asked in the survey.

A year on, we've just finished putting together the first working paper, which you can find on SSRN [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3739543)!

In the paper, we highlight five key insights about budgeting:

1. **Budgeting is highly prevalent across all consumers.** Over 65% of survey respondents reported that they currently budget in some form. This was fairly consistent across household income levels and asset levels.
2. **The frequency with which consumers assess their budgets is negatively correlated with financial-wellbeing.** In both the survey data and bank data, we find evidence that consumers in poorer financial positions tend to check their budgets/banking app more frequently.
3. **Nearly all consumers budget by tracking their spending within categories of consumption.** Over 90% of survey respondents reported doing so - an interesting finding given that past research has found that many people fail to treat their funds as fungible across these categories.
4. **Although the use of "budgetary categories" is common, there is wide heterogeneity in the granularity of these categories between consumers.** Some consumers budget with broad categories (e.g., Necessity, Discretionary), while others budget with more specific categories (e.g., Rent, Utilities, Internet, Car, etc.).
5. **Consumers respond differently depending on whether they have too much or too little remaining in their budgets.** While over 85% of survey respondents would adjust their spending or budget limits if they overspent, under 30% would make adjustments if they underspent.

In reading these insights, it may seem that some of them are fairly obvious or intuitive. At the time of writing, however, there exists limited empirical research examining how and why people budget - despite it being frequently talked about (in both the academic literature and the media)! We hope that our findings help to spark discussion and promote further research on budgeting.
