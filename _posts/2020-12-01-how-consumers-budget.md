About a year ago, I began working on a research project with Yiwei Zhang (Assistant Professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison), Abigail Sussman (Associate Professor, University of Chicago), and Jennifer Lyu (PhD student, University of Colorado Boulder). Yiwei, Abby, and Jen had recently surveyed U.S. respondents on their budgeting beliefs and behaviours, and were interested in knowing whether we could use objective bank data to support (or contradict) their findings. This kicked off a large data exploration exercise as we searched for real-world analogues to the questions that had been asked in the survey.

A year on, we've just finished putting together the first working paper, which you can find on SSRN [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3739543)!
