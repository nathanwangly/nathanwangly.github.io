Managing debt can be challenging for consumers - according to an ASIC report released in 2017, about one in five Australian credit card holders showed some indication of problematic debt. The average Australian has a credit card balance of $3,200; the average Australian also receives a $2,500 tax refund. As the Financial Wellbeing team at CBA, we saw an opportunity to encourage customers to use their tax refunds to make a meaningful reduction in their debt.

To do so, we created a two-stage digital experience that we delivered via the CommBank mobile app:

* **Pre-tax message:** Customers received a message in June 2019 (i.e., before their tax refunds were available) suggesting that they could use their tax refunds to pay down high-interest debt and the benefits of doing so. Customers could also ask for a reminder message, which we offered to elicit a soft pre-commitment.
* **Post-tax message:** Upon receiving their tax refund, customers received a message encouraging them to use it to pay off their debt. Customers who were interested would be taken through a repayment flow that we had designed to nudge them towards higher repayments (e.g., defaulting the repayment amount to the full tax refund).
