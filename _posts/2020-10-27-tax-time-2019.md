**Summary**


**Background**

Managing debt can be challenging for consumers - according to an ASIC report released in 2017, about one in five Australian credit card holders showed some indication of problematic debt.<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> The average Australian has a credit card balance of $3,200; the average Australian also receives a $2,500 tax refund. As the Financial Wellbeing team at CBA, we saw an opportunity to encourage customers to use their tax refunds to make a meaningful reduction in their debt.

There were a few challenges we were trying to solve for:

* People often view financial windfalls (e.g., bonuses) as differently to their earned income - and are more likely to spend them.
* By the time people receive their tax refunds, they may have already mentally spent the money (e.g., decided to use it on a holiday)
* Asking people to make a pre-commitment is difficult because it is uncertain how much one will receive as a tax refund and how much one's credit card balance will be at the time

**Intervention**

Keeping this all in mind, we landed on a two-stage digital experience that we delivered via the CommBank mobile app:

* **Pre-tax message:** Customers received a message in June 2019 (i.e., before their tax refunds were available) suggesting that they could use their tax refunds to pay down high-interest debt and the benefits of doing so. We wanted to get customers thinking about how they could best use their tax refund. Customers could also opt into a simple reminder message, which we offered as a way for them to indicate their (soft) pre-commitment to debt repayment.
* **Post-tax message:** Upon receiving their tax refund, customers received a message encouraging them to use it to pay off their debt. We used a real-time trigger which detected receipt of the tax refund, hoping to catch customers before the money could be spent elsewhere. Customers who were interested would be taken through a repayment flow that we had designed to nudge them towards higher repayments (e.g., defaulting the repayment amount to the full tax refund).

**Eligibility**

We were wary that the intervention we had designed might not be right for everyone. For example, if a customer was a transactor - someone who regularly pays off their credit card balance in full - then they might be better off saving their tax refund, investing it, or treating themselves with a purchase.

This led us to design an eligibility criteria, identifying customers who we thought were more likely to benefit from repaying their debts:

* Customers who were currently in arrears on any debt product
* Customers who had recently exited arrears
* Customers who had revolved on their credit card for the past 3 months, with a balance of at least $350
