Managing debt can be challenging for consumers - according to an ASIC report released in 2017, about one in five Australian credit card holders showed some indication of problematic debt.[^1] The average Australian has a credit card balance of $3,200; the average Australian also receives a $2,500 tax refund. As the Financial Wellbeing team at CBA, we saw an opportunity to encourage customers to use their tax refunds to make a meaningful reduction in their debt.

There were a few challenges we were trying to solve for:

* People often view financial windfalls (e.g., bonuses) as differently to their earned income - and are more likely to spend them.
* By the time people receive their tax refunds, they may have already mentally spent the money (e.g., decided to use it on a holiday)
* Asking people to make a pre-commitment is difficult because it is uncertain how much one will receive as a tax refund and how much one's credit card balance will be at the time

Keeping this all in mind, we landed on a two-stage digital experience that we delivered via the CommBank mobile app:

* **Pre-tax message:** Customers received a message in June 2019 (i.e., before their tax refunds were available) suggesting that they could use their tax refunds to pay down high-interest debt and the benefits of doing so. We wanted to get customers thinking about how they could best use their tax refund. Customers could also opt into a simple reminder message, which we offered as a way for them to indicate their (soft) pre-commitment to debt repayment.
* **Post-tax message:** Upon receiving their tax refund, customers received a message encouraging them to use it to pay off their debt. We used a real-time trigger which detected receipt of the tax refund, hoping to catch customers before the money could be spent elsewhere. Customers who were interested would be taken through a repayment flow that we had designed to nudge them towards higher repayments (e.g., defaulting the repayment amount to the full tax refund).

We delivered this digital experience to approximately 250,000 customers who we thought were most likely to benefit from debt repayment:

* Customers who were currently in arrears on any debt product
* Customers who had recently exited arrears
* Customers who had revolved on their credit card for the past 3 months, with a balance of at least $350
