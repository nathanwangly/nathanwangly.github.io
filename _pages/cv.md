## Work experience

**2019-Present: Behavioural Research Manager, Commonwealth Bank of Australia**

Working within the Behavioural Economics team at CBA, my overarching purpose is to apply behavioural science with the purpose of improving the financial wellbeing of customers and the wider Australian community.

My role as a Behavioural Research Manager involves two components: supporting the design and delivery of business initiatives, and collaborating on academic research projects with universities.

My business delivery responsibilities have included:
* Adding scientific rigour to business initiatives (e.g., by developing robust experimental designs or producing literature reviews)
* Performing data analysis (using R, SQL) to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and to produce insights that inform key strategic and prioritisation decisions
* Collaborating within an Agile environment to deliver as part of a multidisciplinary digital design team; including UX designers, developers, and data scientists

Research projects I have contributed to/supported include:
* Testing hypotheses about why customers simultaneously hold credit card debt and liquid savings
* Exploring customers' budgeting and mental accounting behaviours

**2017-2018: Summer Intern, Ernst & Young (People Advisory Services)**
* Performed data transformation and analysis using Excel and Python
* Produced insights such as poor inventory management and ineffective contract KPIs, resulting in significant savings for a $300+ million contract
* Created data visualisations using TIBCO Spotfire for client reports and presentations

## Other experiences

**2017-2018: President, Enactus UNSW**

During my final year of university, I led [Enactus UNSW](https://enactusunsw.org/) - a non-profit student organisation consisting of over 80 members across 12 teams. The purpose of the organisation is to bring together like-minded students who are passionate about developing social enterprises that can tackle problems faced by our communities. I owe a lot of what I know today to this experience, which taught me about leadership, design thinking, and stakeholder management.

**2016: Bootcamp Participant, Austern International**

At the end of my second year at university, I spent a few weeks in Singapore as part of the Austern program. The program consisted of two week-long sprints where we were introduced to two startups (ReFUEL4 and Caterspot), heard their problems, and scrambled to put together presentation decks with our proposed solutions. The experience taught me about how I handle pressure and tight deadlines, but I remember it for the lifelong friends I made and the fun of exploring a new country.
