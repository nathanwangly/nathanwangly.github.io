## About me

Hello! I'm a second-year psychology PhD student at the University of New South Wales. My research interests lie in understanding the way that uncertainty influences people's decisions, particularly those involving risk and long-term consequences; for example, how we decide to save for retirement or to adapt our behaviours when faced with climate change.

While completing my PhD, I am currently working at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia as a behavioural scientist in their Financial Wellbeing team. My role involves a combination of research and application, aiming to take an evidence-based approach to improving Australians' financial outcomes.

I aspire to become an effective research-practitioner - someone who can bring innovative ideas and rigour from research, and who possesses the practical experience to implement these ideas to solve challenging societal problems.
