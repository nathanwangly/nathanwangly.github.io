  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I am currently an Online Program Director at UNSW, leading the development of postgraduate programs in Business Psychology and Climate Risk.</p>

  <p>With a background at the intersection of behavioural science and banking, I previously led the Customer Decision Science team at ANZ. Today, I balance my academic work with independent behavioural science consulting, helping organisations apply psychological insights to complex challenges.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I enjoy running, lazing at home with my two British Shorthair cats (Chonkie & Bonkie), and tinkering on niche passion projects when inspiration strikes.</p>
