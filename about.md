<b>Hi, I'm Nathan 👋</b>

I am currently an Online Program Director at UNSW, leading the development of postgraduate programs in Business Psychology and Climate Risk.

With a background at the intersection of behavioural science and banking, I previously led the Customer Decision Science team at ANZ—with the goal of improving financial decision making and outcomes for consumers. Nowadays, I balance my academic role with behavioural science consulting, helping organisations apply psychological insights to all sorts of people-related challenges.

In my spare time, I enjoy exercising (mostly running & the gym), lounging at home with my two British Shorthair cats (Chonkie & Bonkie), and tinkering on passion projects that solve niche pain points I've encountered.
